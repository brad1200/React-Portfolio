            <p>
                My name is Brad Carlson. I am 22 years young! I live in Kansas where I was born and raised. Playing video games and working out in my free time is what I enjoy to do to pass time. Something interesting about me is that I work at a meat market which is a very different job that I never expected to do but I have learned a lot from.
